* A favicon
* dropdown for class years
* alternatives to GitHub (like GitLab, etc)
  - maybe instagram as well?
* move the social media buttons to right below the name
  - or enforce a certain length from the row bottom. right now, they can become misaligned when some people have longer taglines than others
* tolerate full URLs for linkedin, etc
  - right now we require just the username
* Revisit responsiveness on medium/small screens
  - Hopefully the class dropdown should fix this, but we may want to actually use a fold-out menu
